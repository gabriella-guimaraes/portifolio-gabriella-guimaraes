      <h1 className="about-tittle">What I'm all about.</h1>
      <p className="about-text">Started my journey as a freelance self taught designer
      at high school. I created concept arts, portraits, personalized designs, photo and
      video editing, media kits for blogs and websites for small business.
      When I studied about Web Design I learned about Front-End development and found a
      way to unite my two passions: Art and Technology.
      <br/>In 2020 I was part of the 5th generation of <a href="https://www.laboratoria.la/br" target="blank"><i>Laborat√≥ria's Bootcamp</i></a>, a Latin American 
      social organization that seeks to train women for the technology area. During the course, I specialized in several technologies such
      as Javascript, HTML 5, CSS 3, React.js, Node.js, Firebase, Git, Github, UI and UX design, Responsive Web Design,
      Accessibility and Jest testing. Besides, I was able to improve my self-learning and teamwork.
      <br/> Determination, resilience, constant search for knowledge, empathy, proactivity, adaptability, communication and a lot of love for
      everything I do complement my personal and professional profile.</p>
